      deemed to include REALTOR ASSOCIATE®s.
    </p><br>
    <p class="general">
      While the Code of Ethics establishes obligations that may be higher than

      Preamble
    </p>
    <p class="general">
      Under all is the land. Upon its wise utilization and widely allocated
      ownership depend the survival and growth of free institutions and of our
      civilization. REALTORS® should recognize that the interests of the nation
      and its citizens require the highest and best use of the land and the
      widest distribution of land ownership. They require the creation of
      adequate housing, the building of functioning cities, the development of
      productive industries and farms, and the preservation of a healthful
      environment.
    </p><br>
    <p class="general">
      Such interests impose obligations beyond those of ordinary commerce. They
      impose grave social responsibility and a patriotic duty to which REALTORS®
      should dedicate themselves, and for which they should be diligent in
      preparing themselves. REALTORS®, therefore, are zealous to maintain and
      improve the standards of their calling and share with their fellow
      REALTORS® a common responsibility for its integrity and honor.
    </p><br>
    <p class="general">
      In recognition and appreciation of their obligations to clients,
      customers, the public, and each other, REALTORS® continuously strive to
      become and remain informed on issues affecting real estate and, as
      knowledgeable professionals, they willingly share the fruit
      of their experience and study with others. They identify and take steps,
      through enforcement of this Code of Ethics and by assisting appropriate
      regulatory bodies, to eliminate practices which may damage the public or
      which might discredit or bring dishonor
      to the real estate profession. REALTORS® having direct personal knowledge
      of conduct that may violate the Code of Ethics involving misappropriation
      of client or customer funds or property, willful discrimination, or fraud
      resulting in substantial economic harm, bring such matters to the
      attention of the appropriate Board or Association of REALTORS®. (Amended
      1/00)
    </p><br>
    <p class="general">
      Realizing that cooperation with other real estate professionals promotes
      the best interests of those who utilize their services, REALTORS® urge
      exclusive representation of clients; do not attempt to gain any unfair
      advantage over their competitors; and they refrain from making unsolicited
      comments about other practitioners.
      In instances where their opinion is sought, or where REALTORS® believe
      that comment is necessary, their opinion is offered in an objective,
      professional manner, uninfluenced by any personal motivation or potential
      advantage or gain.
    </p><br>
    <p class="general">
      The term REALTOR® has come to connote competency, fairness, and high
      integrity resulting from adherence to a lofty ideal of moral conduct in
      business relations. No inducement of profit and no instruction from
      clients ever can justify departure from this ideal.
    </p><br>
    <p class="general">
      In the interpretation of this obligation, REALTORS® can take no safer
      guide than that which has been handed down through the centuries, embodied
      in the Golden Rule, “Whatsoever ye would that others should do to you, do
      ye even so to them.”
    </p><br>
    <p class="general">
      Accepting this standard as their own, REALTORS® pledge to observe its
      spirit in all of their activities whether conducted personally, through
      associates or others, or via technological means, and to conduct their
      business in accordance with the tenets set forth below. (Amended 1/07)
